However, existing open-sourced simulators for surgical robot are\nstill not sufficiently supporting human interactions through physical input\ndevices, which further limits effective investigations on how the human\ndemonstrations would affect policy learning. In this work, we study\nhuman-in-the-loop embodied intelligence with a new interactive simulation\nplatform for surgical robot learning. Specifically, we establish our platform\nbased on our previously released SurRoL simulator with several new features\nco-developed to allow high-quality human interaction via an input device. We\nshowcase the improvement of our simulation environment with the designed new\nfeatures, and validate effectiveness of incorporating human factors in embodied\nintelligence through the use of human demonstrations and reinforcement learning\nas a representative example. Promising results are obtained in terms of\nlearning efficiency. Lastly, five new surgical robot training tasks are\ndeveloped and released, with which we hope to pave the way for future research\non surgical embodied intelligence.

However, existing open-sourced simulators for surgical robot are\nstill not sufficiently supporting human interactions through physical input\ndevices, which further limits effective investigations on how the human\ndemonstrations would affect policy learning. In this work, we study\nhuman-in-the-loop embodied intelligence with a new interactive simulation\nplatform for surgical robot learning. Specifically, we establish our platform\nbased on our previously released SurRoL simulator with several new features\nco-developed to allow high-quality human interaction via an input device. We\nshowcase the improvement of our simulation environment with the designed new\nfeatures, and validate effectiveness of incorporating human factors in embodied\nintelligence through the use of human demonstrations and reinforcement learning\nas a representative example. Promising results are obtained in terms of\nlearning efficiency. Lastly, five new surgical robot training tasks are\ndeveloped and released, with which we hope to pave the way for future research\non surgical embodied intelligence.

To tackle this problem, this paper introduces\n\\textit{Diffusion for Open-ended Goals} (DOG), a novel framework designed to\nenable embodied AI to plan and act flexibly and dynamically for open-ended task\ngoals. DOG synergizes the generative prowess of diffusion models with\nstate-of-the-art, training-free guidance techniques to adaptively perform\nonline planning and control. Our evaluations demonstrate that DOG can handle\nvarious kinds of novel task goals not seen during training, in both maze\nnavigation and robot control problems.

Education reform is urgently needed, but\nnot easily implemented, largely due to an already jam-packed medical curricula.\nIn this article, we propose an education reform framework as an effective and\nefficient solution, which we call the Embedded AI Ethics Education Framework.\nUnlike other calls for education reform to accommodate AI teaching that are\nmore radical in scope, our framework is modest and incremental. It leverages\nexisting bioethics or medical ethics curricula to develop and deliver content\non the ethical issues associated with medical AI, especially the harms of\ntechnology misuse, disuse, and abuse that affect the risk-benefit analyses at\nthe heart of healthcare. In doing so, the framework provides a simple tool for\ngoing beyond the \"What?\" and the \"Why?\" of medical AI ethics education, to\nanswer the \"How?\", giving universities, course directors, and/or professors a\nbroad road-map for equipping their students with the necessary clinical\nproficiency in medical AI.",

Growing healthcare data volumes and diversification\nmean that medical information is becoming more valuable. Many Health Centers\nuse various technologies to ease the classification, storage, and exchange of\nbig data. This use can also make the health data of the users at risk and\nvulnerable. AI and blockchain are among the leading technologies at hand. With\nAI, data-driven operations and big data efficiency have been improved with\nrespect to traditional techniques. Due to its potential to bring about\nimprovements in health services and lower medical costs, this AI technology is\nregularly used in healthcare. Blockchain helps protect transactions on sharing\ninformation and private privacy as long as the exchange of knowledge is that of\nthe standard. The objective of this analysis is to investigate the research and\nunique contributions since 2008 regarding blockchain-integrated AI and\nhealthcare systems. The work sheds light on applied AI-based healthcare schemes\nwith machine, ballistic, and acrylic learning and disparate blockchain\nstructures. The use of technology in order to ensure patient data security and\nmanage medical information effectively in healthcare settings offers a highly\nsuccessful position for both healthcare providers and patients.

This study carries out a scoping review of the\ncurrent state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies following the\nPRISMA framework. The goal was to find the most advanced technologies used in\ndifferent domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three\nrecognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning\ndomain: Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine\nLearning Research, and Machine Learning, and articles published in 2022 were\nobserved. Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the\ntechnology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or\notherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must\nshow improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts\nof the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the\ndata gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured and\nthe technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum\nmanual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating\nlabeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or\nsemi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched. The\nlearning algorithms should be able to be updated efficiently, and predictions\nshould be interpretable. Using artificial intelligence technologies in\nreal-world applications, safety and explainable predictions are mandatory to\nconsider before mass adoption can occur.",

This study carries out a scoping review of the\ncurrent state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies following the\nPRISMA framework. The goal was to find the most advanced technologies used in\ndifferent domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three\nrecognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning\ndomain: Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine\nLearning Research, and Machine Learning, and articles published in 2022 were\nobserved. Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the\ntechnology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or\notherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must\nshow improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts\nof the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the\ndata gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured and\nthe technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum\nmanual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating\nlabeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or\nsemi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched. The\nlearning algorithms should be able to be updated efficiently, and predictions\nshould be interpretable. Using artificial intelligence technologies in\nreal-world applications, safety and explainable predictions are mandatory to\nconsider before mass adoption can occur.",

Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the\ntechnology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or\notherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must\nshow improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts\nof the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the\ndata gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured and\nthe technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum\nmanual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating\nlabeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or\nsemi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched.

Key Technologies\n\n### Core Technologies\n- **Probabilistic Deep Learning Reliability Modelling**: As proposed in Paper 2, this approach combines the power of deep learning with probabilistic models to provide more accurate and reliable predictions of equipment failures. It can handle the uncertainty in the data and provide confidence intervals for the predictions.\n- **Unsupervised and Semi - supervised Learning**: As mentioned in Paper 1, these learning technologies are becoming increasingly important due to the labor - intensive nature of creating labeled datasets. They can be used to pre - process the unstructured data collected from IIoT devices and discover hidden patterns.\n- **Federated Learning**: This technology, as discussed in Paper 3, allows the machine learning models to be trained on decentralized data sources without sharing the raw data. This is beneficial for industries where data privacy and security are major concerns.\n\n### Algorithms\n- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Can be used for analyzing time - series data collected from sensors, such as vibration data, to detect patterns related to equipment failures.\n- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants (e.g., LSTM, GRU)**: Suitable for handling sequential data, which is common in industrial sensor data. They can capture the temporal dependencies in the data and make more accurate predictions.\n\n## 4.
